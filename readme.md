2011-13330 SNU CLS Seokmo-Yoo, August 2020

Based on Long Short Term Memory(Sepp Hochreiter et al. 1997), which is effective model to predict time series data, I developed a simple prediction model of temperature and precipitation in weather sensory data. After training the model by observed data, I compared the result with the real data and analyzed the error of the result by numerical methods to discuss about accuracy.
